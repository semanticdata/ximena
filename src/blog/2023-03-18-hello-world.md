This must be the fourth time I have started a blog. I haven't been very successful at being a consistent content producer. That changes today. I made a promise I can't break. I have made a real commitment to someone in my life, who I rather not disappoint.

The past few years have been difficult for me. I am privileged enough to have access to the resources I do. It is a scary thought; wondering where I would be without therapy and all the other resources I'm able to use.

Since June 2022, I have been pushing myself to journal more often. Note-taking has changed the way I digest information. I've experienced the "productivity app rodeo". Jumping from productivity app to productivity app. Never settling, never producing content, just focused on the "workflow". I think I'm past that. It's time I sit down and type.

I can't go on without mentioning some inspiring people I have had the pleasure of coming across. When it comes to blogging and just being great overall, I highly recommend following the likes of:

- [Andy Bell](https://andy-bell.co.uk/)
- [Derek Sivers](https://sive.rs/)
- [Drew DeVault](https://drewdevault.com/)
- [Eric Bower](https://erock.prose.sh/)
- [Herman Martinus](https://herman.bearblog.dev/)

Hope you found reading this worthwhile. If you take anything from this post, let it be:

Take care, and maybe I'll see you in the next post.
